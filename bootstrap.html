		<p><h2>FACTS ABOUT THE SEA</h2></p>
		
		<p><ol>
			
			<li>The sea plays a part in the water cycle, in which water evaporates from the ocean, travels through the atmosphere as vapor, condenses, falls (usually as rain or snow) again, and then largely returns to the sea.[82 </li>
		
			<p><li>Earth is the only known planet with seas of liquid water on its surface </li></p>
		
			<p><li>A sea is a large body of salt water that is surrounded in whole or in part by land </li></p>
		
		</ol></p>
		
		<p><h2> HOW MUCH WATER IS IN THE SEA!</h2></p>
		
			<p><ul>
				
				<li>The area of the World Ocean is about 361.9 million square kilometers (139.7 million square miles), which covers about 70.9% of Earth's surface, and its volume is approximately 1.335 billion cubic kilometers (320.3 million cubic miles). </li>
			
			
			</ul></p>
			
			<h2><p> Ten amazing facts about fishes!</h2><ol>
			
			<p><li>Fish is a poikilothermic cold-blooded water-dwelling vertebrate with gills.</li></P>
			
			<p><li>There are over 28,000 fish species in the world</li></P>
			
			<p><li>Fishes can be found in almost all large bodies of water in either salt, brackish and fresh water, at depths ranging from just below the surface to several thousand meters.</li></p>
			
			<p><li>Certain species of fishes maintain elevated body temperatures and may be considered endothermic to varying degrees.</li></p>
			
			<P><li>Fish range in size from the huge 16-metre (52 ft) whale shark to the tiny 8-millimetre (0.3 in) stout infantfish.</li></p>
			
			<P><li>Fish have a closed-loop circulatory system. The heart pumps the blood in a single loop throughout the body.</li></p>
			
			<p><li>Fish can be found in nearly all aquatic environments, from high mountain streams to the abyssal and even hadal depths of the deepest oceans</li></p>
			
			<p><li>Fish exchange gases by pulling oxygen-rich water through their mouths and pumping it over their gills.</li></p>
			
			<p><li>As with many aquatic animals, most fish release their nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. Some of the wastes diffuse through the gills</li></p>
			
			<p><li>Fishes are perhaps one of the hardest subjects to photograph. </li></p>

			<p><h2>Fishes</h2> All Types of Fish Species

Here we have the first creatures with a backbone that started their murky lives some 440 million years ago. "Fishes" scientists often like to say and write to refer to many species of fish, as opposed to the simple plural and singular form of the word "fish". Among fishes, you will find a big, diverse group of sea animals with heads, fins, gills and backbones. Fish and water are inseparable! Where you find water you will find fish and vice versa. Sea mammals and invertebrates are not fish. Shellfish, cuttlefish, starfish, crayfish and jellyfish, despite the names, are not fish. Most fish are cold-blooded but a few, like tuna for example, are warm-blooded.</p>
